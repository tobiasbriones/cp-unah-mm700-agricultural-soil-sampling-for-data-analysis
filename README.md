Course project for the final B.Math career course consisting of a research
project about agricultural soil sampling modeling for applying data analysis
efficiently to agricultural soils.

The course was quarterly (three months long) where the student takes their
research topic and develops a technical article about that topic on their own
with little to no mentorship or feedback (at the time and campus where I took
the course). I still managed to get some insights from an outside organization,
check out the article for more details.
