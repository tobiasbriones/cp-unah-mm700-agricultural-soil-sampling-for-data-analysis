# Article

Files [framework.tex](framework/framework.tex), [process.tex](process/process.tex)
and [annexes.tex](annexes/annexes.tex) get updated and then manually "merged" into the
big file [article.tex](./article.tex).

Notice that the article file has some special formatting values as it is a two
column article so its content should not be just completely replaced when 
"manually merging it" but update just the part that changed from the smaller
files.
